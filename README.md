Import Firefox Bookmarks to Qutebrowser Quickmarks
================================================== 

This script is almost the same as
https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/scripts/importer.py with
the tweak that it add tags you added in Firefox bookmarks and prefixes them to
the qutebrowser quickmark, which seemed to be missing in the original script.

Tested Firefox version: (64.0.2)

Export your bookmarks from Firefox as html.

For usage, see comments in file.
